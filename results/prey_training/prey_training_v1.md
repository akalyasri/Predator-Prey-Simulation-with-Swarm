Prey training complete. Best prey saved.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

1. Prey fitness starts around ~250-300
This makes sense bc early prey are dumb and get caught quickly

2. Best prey quickly reaches 800–1000 fitness
This is good, it means:
- Prey is learning to survive longer
- Prey increases distance from predator
- Our environment and obstacle-aware observations are working
- NEAT is exploring better fleeing strategies

3. Multiple “species” appear
This means NEAT is creating different evolutionary niches, some exploring:
- wall avoidance, obstacle hiding, spiraling evasion, boundary circling

Neccessary for our simulation

4. Stagnation resets happen 
The logs show a line like: Species 1 stagnated: removing it

This is normal. It means NEAT tries a strategy -> runs out of improvements -> kills that branch -> tries new strategies. Which is exactly what we want in adversarial learning

5. Fitness spikes above 1000
- Best fitness: 1053.09106
- Best fitness: 1039.98231

This means the prey has learned:
- to survive full 500 steps
- to stay extremely far away from predator
- sometimes even use obstacles as a shield

This means the prey can now challenge the predator
